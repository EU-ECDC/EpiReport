Description: The 'EpiReport' package allows the user to draft an epidemiological report 
  in Microsoft Word format for a given disease, similar to the Annual 
  Epidemiological Reports published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 
  Through standalone functions, the package is specifically designed 
  The package includes:
  - Table with the distribution of cases by Member State over the last five years
  - Seasonal plot with the distribution of cases at the European Union / European Economic Area 
  level, by month, over the past five years
  - Trend plot with the trend and number of cases at the European Union / European Economic Area 
  level, by month, over the past five years
  - Age and gender bar graph with the distribution of cases at the European Union / European Economic Area level
  Two types of datasets can be used:
  - The default dataset included in the 'EpiReport package which includes 
  Salmonellosis data for 2012-2016;
  - Any dataset specified as described in the package vignette.
