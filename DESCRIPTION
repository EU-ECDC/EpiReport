Description: The EpiReport package allows the user to draft an epidemiological report similar to the ECDC Annual 
  Epidemiological Reports (see https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/annual-epidemiological-reports) 
  in Microsoft Word format for a given disease. 
  Through standalone functions, the package is specifically designed 
  to generate each disease-specific output presented in these reports.
  The package includes:
  - Table with the distribution of cases by Member State over the last five years
  - Seasonal plot with the distribution of cases at EU/EEA level, by month, 
  over the past five years
  - Trend plot with the trend and number of cases at EU/EEA level, by month, 
  over the past five years
  - Age and gender bar graph__ with the distribution of cases at EU/EEA level
  Two types of datasets can be used:
  - The default dataset included in the `EpiReport` package which includes 
  Salmonellosis data for 2012-2016;
  - Any dataset specified as described in the package vignette.
